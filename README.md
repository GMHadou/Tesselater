# Tesselater
#1-Introduction and inspiration

A open-source program to emulate a geometrical tesselation enviroment for 3d printing and real world interaction.This tool was originally inspired by
Will-it-print and inherited some mathmatical methods,while expanding upon the unfinished parts and optimizing the algorithm to both run faster and become
a more usable and viable option for both experts and newcomers when dealing with PLA FDM(Additive Manufacturing) part analysis.This project could potentially aim at
different types of printers or filaments in the near future.
