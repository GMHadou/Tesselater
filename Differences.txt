About support and  Thresholds:The analysis of overhanging facets and Roughness is done based on the default limit of fdm
printers(45 degrees).Also,small Part analysis takes on the analysis with a oriented nozzle width of 4 mm(default).If your case is more particular,you could change
some of these and attain a result that's more in context with your printer.

Toppling:While a great guideline,I disagree with the method presented in the study WillItPrint.It's not to say that the stability analysis by comparation of the center of mass
to the bed support area is wrong,since it's a physical law of static objects,but it's incomplete,leaving only exceptional
cases for toppling and limiting it's reach.Think of a straight,very thin,cylinder.Although it's center of mass is inside
the defined proportions of the convex hull and even can be projected inside it,it's likely to topple in some cases.The motive is:
Because of it's thin area of contact with the base,it has very limited adhesive forces(if not reinforced by a Brim).THat's
specially troublesome when you add the vibration movement it suffers from the nozzle movement,printing the lines above the base
,causing it to tremble and ,gradually, lose even more grip on the base,causing it to topple.So,i tried to correct it by defining
a relation between the part's *height* and it's *base area*,putting a threshold limit that can be changed for the printer
(It's measured taking base on a 19~~19.5 radius circle area divided by 118 mm height,which gives 9,67 as default threshold
but it's very Empirical).
That allows to more abundant predictions and checks on the part.For toppling avoidance,some parts are recommended to have Brim
if tall enough.

Warping:Geometrical analysis of warping is very limited.Warping,while almost always limited to corners(because they are
the part with increased anomalous heat dispersion[The isolated structure] and reheating delay),is very much dependant on
Print Bed cleaning and temperature regulation,rather than the geometry itself.So,while this method could be credited by analysing
the size of the edges,number of spiky corners and parts within first layer reach(Usually happens either in first layer or close),it doesn't
consider the height which it can be "pulled".There is a interisting study concerning IA for warping prediction though,which i will leave here
for further study of those who have access:

Temperature:Although the code doesn't offer a Temperature optimization directly,since it would be too divergent for a general analysis,
it optimizes the geometry,which in case optimizes heat dispersion.If you want to go ahead and calibrate or search for a
temperature optimization method,i strongly suggest you use the GCodeutils or Octoprint smart calibration,since both offer a way to
optimize the temperature.It's also interesting to check your filament and spool,for material quality checks.
Problems avoided with this:Stringing,uneven surface(blobs),warping(partially),Toppling(Generated by warping) and basically almost every other
major problem presented in this analysis.

Roughness:Cells that need support(overhanged) and are directly in contact with it WILL be rough,since there's a minimal fusion
for stability.
