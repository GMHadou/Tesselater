Enhancing Support and Thresholds:

When analyzing overhanging facets and roughness, we rely on the default parameters of FDM printers (set at 45 degrees). Additionally, our small part analysis is conducted with an oriented nozzle width of 4 mm (default setting). However, for more tailored results aligned with your printer's specifications, feel free to adjust these parameters accordingly.

Main.py:
This file serves as the hub for the main menu and essential definitions.

Non-Watertight:
In real-world printing, meticulous attention to surface openings and infill specifications is crucial. Failure to ensure cleanliness and precision may necessitate corrective measures. While there are functions within the main.py file to address this, a deeper understanding is recommended.

Toppling:
ATTENTION: This code is incomplete and requires incorporation of support area into the base calculus to generate accurate estimations. Additionally, the calculations provided are not yet empirically proven effective. While the stability analysis method presented in the "WillItPrint" study offers valuable insights, it's inherently incomplete. For instance, consider a straight, thin cylinder; despite meeting the defined stability criteria, it may still topple due to limited adhesive forces. To mitigate this, we propose a novel approach that considers the relationship between a part's height and its base area, allowing for customizable threshold settings tailored to your printer.

Vx.py:
This module is designed to pinpoint overhangs in the mesh and visualize them.

Small_Parts:
Estimates the precision loss in small parts due to printer limitations.

Warping.py:
Warping, often confined to corners, is primarily influenced by print bed cleanliness and temperature regulation. While our method involves analyzing edge size, number of spiky corners, and first layer considerations, it's primarily based on shrinkage percentage and its impact on the first layer. For those interested, we recommend further exploration of warping prediction using visual heat images through the provided research links.

Warping Formula:
A concise formula developed to calculate variables based on user-defined configurations.

Temperature:
While direct temperature optimization isn't provided in the code due to its divergence in a general analysis, optimizing geometry indirectly enhances heat dispersion. For those inclined to calibrate or explore temperature optimization methods, we recommend utilizing tools like GCodeutils or Octoprint smart calibration. Additionally, thorough filament and spool checks are advised for quality assurance.

By optimizing geometry, our approach mitigates various printing issues, including stringing, uneven surfaces (blobs), partial warping, toppling (often triggered by warping), and many others.

Roughness:
Cells requiring support (overhanging) and those in direct contact with it may exhibit roughness due to minimal fusion for stability.
